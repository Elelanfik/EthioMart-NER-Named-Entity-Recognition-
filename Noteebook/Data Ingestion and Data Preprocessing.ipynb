    "üéØ Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Establish a data ingestion system to collect and preprocess messages from Ethiopian-based Telegram e-commerce channels for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "üõ†Ô∏è Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Ingestion\n",
    "\n",
    "- Channel Identification: Select at least five relevant Telegram channels focused on e-commerce.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Custom Scraper Development: Create a web scraper to automate the collection of messages, images, and documents from the identified channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Real-Time Data Collection: Implement a system to fetch data as it is posted, ensuring the dataset remains current.\n",
    "\n",
    "2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text Normalization: Clean the collected text by converting it to a consistent format (e.g., lowercasing, removing special characters).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tokenization: Split the text into individual tokens (words) for easier analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handling Amharic-Specific Features: Address unique linguistic characteristics of the Amharic language, such as diacritics and script variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Structuring\n",
    "\n",
    "- Metadata Separation: Organize the data by separating metadata (e.g., sender, timestamp) from the message content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unified Format Creation: Structure the cleaned data into a consistent format (e.g., CSV, JSON) for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4Ô∏è‚É£ Quality Assurance\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Review: Conduct a thorough review of the collected data to ensure completeness and accuracy, checking for any missing or corrupted entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "5Ô∏è‚É£ Data Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "- Save Preprocessed Data: Store the cleaned and structured data in a suitable format for easy access during the labeling and model training phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Summary of Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify relevant Telegram channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Develop a custom scraper for data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Preprocess the collected data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Structure and organize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Conduct quality assurance and store the data."
